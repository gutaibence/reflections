How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
	Checking bugs will be easier a lot.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
	Git is more flexible, but its not always safe because if i forget to save that can cause a lot of problem.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
	Because these files are connected to each other

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
	Nice and easy.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
	I can easily fix my bugs
